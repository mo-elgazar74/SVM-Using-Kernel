**`svm-using-kernel.ipynb`**  

This notebook demonstrates how **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** use the **kernel trick** to solve classification problems — especially when data is not linearly separable. It explores various kernel functions, how they influence decision boundaries, and compares their performances using intuitive visualizations and synthetic datasets.

## 📌 Introduction

**Support Vector Machines (SVM)** are powerful supervised learning models for classification tasks. While they are inherently linear classifiers, the **kernel trick** allows them to handle non-linear data by projecting inputs into a higher-dimensional feature space where a linear separator can be found.

This notebook provides:

- An intuitive explanation of the **kernel trick**
- Implementation of **linear**, **quadratic**, **polynomial**, and **RBF** kernels using Scikit-learn
- **Visual analysis** to compare decision boundaries
- Discussions on **when to use each kernel**

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Support Vector Machine**: Finds the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes.
- **Kernel Trick**: Allows the SVM to operate in a high-dimensional space without explicitly computing the transformation.
- **Decision Boundary**: A line or curve that separates different classes in a classification problem.

## ⚙️ Kernel Functions Explored

| Kernel Name | Formula | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Linear** | \( K(x, x') = x^T x' \) | For linearly separable data |
| **Quadratic** | \( K(x, x') = (x^T x' + c)^2 \) | A degree-2 polynomial kernel |
| **Polynomial (d ≥ 2)** | \( K(x, x') = (\gamma x^T x' + r)^d \) | Captures complex boundaries, sensitive to overfitting |
| **RBF (Gaussian)** | \( K(x, x') = \exp(-\gamma \|x - x'\|^2) \) | Powerful for non-linear, circular, or irregular class shapes |

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

The notebook includes:

- Data generation using `make_classification` and `make_circles` from `sklearn.datasets`
- Model training using `SVC(kernel=...)` from `sklearn.svm`
- Parameter tuning (`C`, `gamma`, `degree`) for each kernel
- Decision region plotting using `matplotlib` and `numpy`
- Accuracy score and decision function heatmaps

---

## 📈 Visualizations

You’ll find high-quality plots that illustrate:

- How different kernels fit the same dataset
- Strengths and limitations of each kernel
- How hyperparameters like `gamma` and `degree` affect decision boundaries

Sample visualization types include:

- 2D scatter plots with color-coded decision regions
- Overlays of support vectors
- Misclassified points

## 📊 Results and Discussion

The notebook compares kernel performances across datasets:

| Kernel | Accuracy | Suitable For |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Linear | ~85% | Simple, linearly separable data |
| Quadratic | ~92% | Data with curved boundaries |
| Polynomial (d=3) | ~95% | More complex relationships |
| RBF | ~97% | Highly non-linear, flexible boundary |

You’ll also learn:

- Why RBF often outperforms high-degree polynomials
- How to avoid overfitting with `C` and `gamma`
- When a simple linear model might be preferable
